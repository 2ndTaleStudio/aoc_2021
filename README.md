# Advent of Code 2021

This repo contains my attempts to solve the advent-of-code challenges of 2021.
The solutions are written in Rust.

Assuming the Rust toolchain is installed execute the code from the repo root folder like the following:

```bash
$> cargo run --release --bin <day>
```

Here `<day>` will be replaced by `day1`, `day2`, ... respectively.
